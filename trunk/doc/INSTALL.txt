Compiling Double Commander

What you need?

At first must download FreePascal. I use FPC 2.2.4  (or higher).

After this download Lazarus. I use Lazarus 0.9.29 (or higher).

For compiling Double Commander you must install in Lazarus two component packages

from "components" directory. After this open file doublecmd.lpi 

Compile.
